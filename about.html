            <h2>What is Simplistic Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Simplistic Design is a take on Google's <a href="https://material.io" target="_blank">Material Design</a> designed by Isaac Maddox (Esac on <a href="https://codepen.io/esac" target="_blank">CodePen</a>). Simplistic Design is meant to be a "simplified" version of Material Design. I tried using Material Design a couple of times, and while the result would be fantastic as far as design went, there didn't seem to be much organization with the classes that the Google team used. I am not saying that Material Design is bad by any chance, I am just saying that personally found it hard to use. For that purpose and that purpose only, I made this style and script sheet for myself. I decided to publish it to the public on CodePen, but I never got around to finishing it. I finally gained the motivation to start it and power through so that I could have a stylesheet for myself to use.
            </p>
            <h2>Why use Simplistic Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Simplistic Design, as I stated in the previous paragraph, was designed specifically for me, but I decided to publish it on GitHub and CodePen. From there, I made this web page for it, and I am finishing the project. This style and script library is meant to essentially mimic the Material Design feel while not copying the code, and also improving the seemingly (to me) random class names of Material design. I am making all the classes easy to remember and universal. For example, for all things (except for a navbar), to make it a dark theme, you add the class ".sd-dark". Simple. Again, I am not saying that Material Design is bad or inefficient by any means, I just made this stylesheet for myself, so I could also customize the look and feel. 
            </p>
            <h2>Simplistic Design Syntax</h2>
            <p>
                Simplistic Design follows a very basic syntax: every class starts with "sd-" and then the rest of the class is what the element is. For example, the header at the top of this page has the class "sd-page-header". The navigation bar that you see at the top of your screen now has the class "sd-nav". It's that simple. If you want to make the whole page dark themed, you just add the class "sd-dark-theme" to the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I said in the previous section, <a href="https://material.io">Material Design by Google</a> is a great stylesheet, and has a great look and feel, but I personally found it hard to use. So I set off on the mission of making Simplistic Design, so that I could have a somewhat equally good-looking stylesheet with a seemingly simpler class structure.
