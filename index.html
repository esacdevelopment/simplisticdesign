            <h2>What is Simplistic Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Simplistic Design is a take on Google's <a href="https://material.io" target="_blank">Material
                    Design</a> designed by Isaac Maddox (Esac on <a href="https://codepen.io/esac"
                    target="_blank">CodePen</a>). Simplistic Design is meant to be a "simplified" version of Material
                Design. I tried using Material Design a couple of times, and while the result would be fantastic as far
                as design went, there didn't seem to be much organization with the classes that the Google team used. I
                am not saying that Material Design is bad by any chance, I am just saying that personally found it hard
                to use. For that purpose and that purpose only, I made this style and script sheet for myself. I decided
                to publish it to the public on CodePen, but I never got around to finishing it. I finally gained the
                motivation to start it and power through so that I could have a stylesheet for myself to use.
            </p>
            <h2>Why use Simplistic Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Simplistic Design, as I stated in the previous paragraph, was designed specifically for me, but I
                decided to publish it on GitHub and CodePen. From there, I made this web page for it, and I am finishing
                the project. This style and script library is meant to essentially mimic the Material Design feel while
                not copying the code, and also improving the seemingly (to me) random class names of Material design. I
                am making all the classes easy to remember and universal. For example, for all things (except for a
                navbar), to make it a dark theme, you add the class ".sd-dark". Simple. Again, I am not saying that
                Material Design is bad or inefficient by any means, I just made this stylesheet for myself, so I could
                also customize the look and feel.
