      <h2>So yeah this is happening...</h2>
      <p>
        As some of you might know, I previously started a project called "Simplistic Design". This project, however, did
        not work out for me, so I stopped it. This was mainly because I lost motivation for the project. Since then, I
        have wanted to work on projects that would benefit people other than me, so I made a <a
          href="https://esacdevelopment.github.io/AboutMe/Index.html">Github Page</a>. Since I made this page, I have
        made many other programs on GitHub, including <a href="https://esacdevelopment.github.io/Jeapordy/index.html">a
          "Jeopardy!" Game</a>, and <a href="https://esacdevelopment.github.io/simplisticdesign/">Simpistic Design</a>
        (which is still a work in progress). You can check out some of the things that will be in Simplistic Design on
        GitHub, but this is not the full stylesheet and script library.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page was made entirely using Simplistic Design, so that you can see what it looks like just from CodePen.
        This library also works on mobile. Try it out!
      </p>
      <h2>What is Simplistic Design, Again?</h2>
      <p>
        Simplistic Design, as you can see on the <a href="https://esacdevelopment.github.io/simplisticdesign">home page
          for Simplistic Design</a>, is a stylesheet and a JavaScript file used to style webpages. This project is
        mainly for me, as I wanted a way to make webpages easily and beautifully. Simplistic Design also has a dark
        theme. Click <a onClick="changeTheme()" style="cursor: pointer;"><u>this text</u></a> to try that out! For a
        full documentation on what
        Material Design is, go to the <a href="https://esacdevelopment.github.io/simplisticdesign/about.html">about
          page</a> for Simplistic Design. Now, Simplistic Design is not only to benefit me, it is also made for the
        people of the world. If you want to try Simplistic Design, you can download it <a
          href="https://esacdevelopment.github.io/simplisticdesign/download.html">here</a> (keep in mind a better
        download system should be coming soon).
      </p>
      <h2>Why Should I Use Simplistic Design?</h2>
      <p>
        Simplistic Design is supposed to be a personalized (to me), and simpler version of Google's <a
          href="https://material.io" target="_blank">Material Design</a>. In my previous experiences with this amazing
        product by Google, I found it hard to unserstand the class system that they had in place. Therefore, I set out
        on a mission to make my own Material Design but to make the class system a lot more understandable to me. For
        the most part, my class system follows a simple pattern: all classes begin with <code>sd-</code>, and then the
        rest of the class is what the element is. For example, the header at the top of this page has the class
        <code>sd-page-header</code>. Simple!
