            <h2>How can I contact Isaac?</h2>
            <p>
                If you have something you want to send Isaac (like a request or a bug report, etc.), you can e-mail him
                at <a href="mailto:isaacmaddox05@gmail.com">isaacmaddox05@gmail.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                I will respond to e-mails that have to do with Simplistic Design, or any other product that is on my
                GitHub. If your email does not have to do with any of the above, I will not respond to it and I will
                likely put your email address in my spam folder. If you are going to email me, please make sure that the
                email is relevant to something that has to do with coding.
            </p>
            <h2>Where else can I talk to Isaac?</h2>
            <p>
                I also have a <a href="https://codepen.io/esac">CodePen account</a>, as you may know. You can leave a
                comment on one of my pens, although I get notifications for my email, so that is a better way to contact
                me if you need to.
            </p>
            <h2>What can I send Isaac?</h2>
            <p>
                I will accept emails that involve things on GitHub or CodePen. I would like to have a couple of
                submissions of templates or examples using Simplistic Design to put on the <a
                    href="examples.html">examples</a> page. If you have something like that, send the email with the
                subject "Example" or "Template". Attach the HTML in a text document, make sure that it is the full body.
                I will put a template page on this website eventually, but until I do, you will have to type the full
                body. On the <a href="download.html">download</a> page, you can find the things that you will need in
                the head element of your page.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you send the code in the text file, I will look at it, and decide whether or not I like it. If I
                do, I will respond to your email and put the example on my website<sup>1</sup>. You can see any examples
                that were
                made by other people on the <a href="examples.html">examples</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2>When can I Expect a Response?</h2>
            <p>
                My "office hours" are from 4:00 to 6:00, weekdays. I try to be available almost any time over the
                weekend, but I may be doing family things, so don't expect a response immediately please.
            </p>

        <sup>1</sup> By submitting code to my email, you are agreeing that I can copy the code and publish it on my
