            <h2 class="sd-highlight">How to Contact Isaac?</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to contact me, you can email me at <a
                    href="mailto:isaacmaddox05@gmail.com">isaacmaddox05@gmail.com</a>. Alternatively, you can go to <a
                    href="https://codepen.io/esac/pen/pooPLZZ">this page</a> and leave a comment.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sd-highlight-accent">Information</h2>
            <p>
                My "office hours" are from 3:00pm to 6:00pm every afternoon on weekdays. On weekends, I will be able to
                respond almost any time between 9:00am and 6:00pm. Please do not expect a response outside of these
                hours that I have set. Thank you for your patience.
            </p>
            <h2>What to send Isaac?</h2>
            <p>
                I will read any emails that I recieve, but I may not respond to all of them. I especially like emails
                with examples of what you have created using Simplistic Design. I will also definitely pay attention to
                bug reports.
            </p>
            <h2>Emails with Examples</h2>
            <p>
                If you are sending me some code to an example of Simplistic Design in action, please make the subject
                "SD Example", or something similar.
            </p>
            <h2>Emails with Bug Reports</h2>
            <p>
                I will pay special attention to emails that have to do with bug reports, as I would like to keep
                Simplistic Design as bug-free as possible. For an email concerning bugs, please send with the title "SD
                Bug Report", or something very similar. I will make sure to respond and get the bug fixed as fast as I
                can. In the body, please include a description of the bug, as well as a screenshot, if applicable. In
                the release notes of the release in which the bug is fixed, I will credit the <strong>first person who I
                    saw</strong> send me the email. I will not dig through my inbox to find the first person to report
                this. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
            </p>
